# Webscraping
Webcrawler and scraper

A project built during Internship at 13:37. Trying out their new code-test for new senior develpoer hires.

Crawls and scrapes a given website. Reconstructs whole file system locally with html,pictures,css,js,etc so that the website when application is done can be run locally.

Threading not super impressive but was a great learning experience.
